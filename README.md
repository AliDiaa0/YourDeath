# YourDeath
A stupid C# computer virus (Windows-only) that can scare kids, destroy your operating system, and delete your personal files.

This piece of junk is written by me. Please don't just copy and paste the source code as your own work. Copying / stealing people's work isn't nice. Please respect my code.

There may be other versions of this virus in the future, I'm not sure.

Note: You must install .NET Framework version 4 before executing this virus. Otherwise, the virus will not work!

Note 2: I had to put the download links in Mediafire due to their large sizes.
